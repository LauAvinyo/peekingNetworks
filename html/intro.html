            <div class="paragraf">
                The phenomena we have just decribed are examples of complex systems. They are composed of many simple units, interacting in such a way that an emergent behaviour appears that can not be deduced from the behaviour of the units by themselves.  The internet, which is nothing but a collection of many many servers communicating with each other, is one example of such a system. On a socail scale, we could find Facebook and the set of all the connections between its users. A recent approach to study this kind systems is by modelling them as complex networks.

                    A complex network is defined as a graph with non-trivial topological features, as irregular patterns, which describe the emergent behaviour that we already mentioned. 
            So, first let’s talk a bit about graphs! A graph is defined as a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense related. The objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called vertices (also called nodes or points) and each of the related pairs of vertices is called and edge (also called link or line).
