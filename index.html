        <div class="intro">Maybe you were swimming at the beach this summer and were lucky enough to encounter a school of fish, all moving in a perfectly synchronized manner between currents and other underwater by-passers. Or perhaps you have been amazed witnessing the explosion of popularity of a certain meme on the internet. You may even have wondered how an electrical impulse between neurons turns into a memory, a feeling, or a thought. If this is the case, you already have something in common with a complex network scientist.</div>
