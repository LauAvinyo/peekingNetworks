        <div class="intro">Maybe you were swimming at the beach this summer and were lucky enough to encounter a school of fish, all moving in a perfectly synchronized manner between currents and other underwater by-passers. Or perhaps you have been amazed witnessing the explosion of popularity of a certain meme on the internet.

If this is the case, you already have something in common with a complex network scientist.</div>
        
        Stick women thinking about this sort of stuff.
    
       <div class="paragraf">We are three students from the Master in Physics of Complex Systems at the university of the Balearic Islands (UIB) organised by the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems (IFISC) with a mission: to spread the passion for complex systems and the knowledge of their presence in our lives.</div>
